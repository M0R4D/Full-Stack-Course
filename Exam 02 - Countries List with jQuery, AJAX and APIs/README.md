Here is my second exam in the Full-Stack course at John Bryce college.
We asked to make a website that uses an external API, and displays basic info about all the countries in the world or just specific countries that the user searched for.
I used jQuery, AJAX, Bootstrap to do the task.
Here is a link to see what I do online using GitHub Pages: <a href="https://m0r4d.github.io/Full-Stack-Course/Exam%2002%20-%20Countries%20List%20with%20jQuery,%20AJAX%20and%20APIs/index.html" target="_blank">Exam 02 - CountriesList </a>
