 Pros: 
- Beautiful and easy-to-use user interface.
- Bootstrap is used.
- There is a good division into different Source-Code files.
- There is a good division into folders on the site.
- The image files are all in a folder dedicated to this.
- The CSS code is separated into an external file.
- The JavaScript code is separated into an external file.
- There are significant names for variables and functions.
- There is a proper naming convention for variables and functions.
- There is documentation that allows a better understanding of the code.
- LocalStorage is used to store information locally on the customer side.
- The notes are properly stored locally on the customer side.
- The notes are indeed reloaded at the entrance to the site at a later time.
- You can delete a note by pressing the X.
- The X button appears while hovering over the note - excellent.
- There is a Fade-In effect when adding a note.
- There is a Fade-Out effect when deleting a note.
- There is good use with JSON.
- Great use of the date box.
- Great use of the time absorption box.
- There is validation to prevent the insertion of a note without a description of the task.
- There is validation to prevent the insertion of a note without a date.
- If the text of the note exceeds the limits of the note, the scroller is displayed aesthetically.
- There is aesthetics in the code in terms of spaces, Enter-s, Indentations and so on. Excellent.
- The console is error free.


Cons:
- The JavaScript file is very cluttered, it would have been better to divide the code into several different files.
- You should have set "use strict" at the beginning of the JavaScript code.
- You can create a note with a date that has already passed. It was right to prevent this.
- The boxes do not clear automatically after adding a note, but remain with the previous information that is no longer relevant in the boxes.
- Only one line can be entered in the task description box. It was correct to allow multiple lines to be inserted by using a textarea box instead of a standard text box.
- When adding a note - All notes appear by the Fade-In effect instead of performing this effect only on the note added.
- Sometimes, deleting a note causes the note to be deleted from the page, but Refresh returns the deleted note back, meaning it is not actually deleted from the Storage. But it's pretty rare that happens.


Very good project, contains good work with basic Frontend technologies, contains correct JavaScript logic, has a beautiful UI, contains aesthetic code, performs the necessary characterization.
